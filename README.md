demo of non-.onion version, from which this is forked: https://diafygi.github.io/webrtc-ips/


### What this does

When you visit this site, an HTML5 webRTC request is made to a STUN server, asking your web browser to disclose your physical (ISP) address.

They're tricksy things, + aren't bloked by the usual no-script or ghostery-style extensions. 

There's some links below for more info, + tools to protect yourself whilst visiting .onions.
